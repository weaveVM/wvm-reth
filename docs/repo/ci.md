## CI

The CI runs a couple of workflows:

### Code

- **[ci]**: A catch-all for small jobs. Currently only runs lints (rustfmt, clippy etc.)
- **[unit]**: Runs unit tests (tests in `src/`) and doc tests
- **[integration]**: Runs integration tests (tests in `tests/` and sync tests)
- **[bench]**: Runs benchmarks

### Docs

- **[book]**: Builds, tests, and deploys the book.

### Meta

- **[deny]**: Runs `cargo deny` to check for license conflicts and security advisories in our dependencies
- **[sanity]**: Runs a couple of sanity checks on the code every night, such as checking for unused dependencies
- **[release]**: Runs the release workflow
